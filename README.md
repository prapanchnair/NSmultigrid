# NSmultigrid
A multigrid Navier Stokes solver
## Phase 1
------
1. Write a NS solver using FDM, use it to solve LDC, Backward facing step. 
2. Use external Libraries for linear systems
3. Build it in a way we can use grids and transformations
4. Use VTK for outputs and Jason for inputs. 

## Phase 2
------
Include a multiphase module/Immersed Boundary module
